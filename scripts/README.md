Here are some scripts for automatic tasks:  
1. [genAll.sh](./genAll.sh) is used to checkout all the projects which have been patched and evaluated correctness from defects4j. For the projects information, please refer to: https://github.com/Ultimanecat/DefectRepairing  
2. [genInvs4Chart.sh](./genInvs4Chart.sh) is used to generate invariants for Chart projects in batch with the directory structure of the results of [genAll.sh](./genAll.sh). You need to patch the projects manually.  
3. [genInvs4Chart.sh](./genInvs4Chart.sh) is used to generate invariants for Lang.  
4. [genInvs4Math.sh](./genInvs4Math.sh) is used to generate invariants for Math.  
5. [outputInvs.sh](./outputInvs.sh) is used to select and output invariants.  
6. [coverageTests.sh](./coverageTests.sh) is used to do coverage test for each test case and find the tests cases related to the buggy class. It can be parallel, but no promise for competition condition (which is few possibility).  
7. [filterRelatedTests.py](./filterRelatedTests.py) is used to do filter the tests that cover the buggy method from the coverage reports generated by [coverageTests.sh](./coverageTests.sh).
